# Disease Detection: Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning 
project Information retrieval for early detection of disease using semantic similarity

-----------------------------------------
### Work Done

* Designed and optimized a data augmentation model to diagnose
a disease by semantic similarity using retrieval principles. Led to a
20% increase accuracy of the early detection of disease system.
* Develop a recommendation or simple information retrieval system
with questions about similar symptoms in patients to help with
early diagnosis of a disease
